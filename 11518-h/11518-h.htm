<h3>CONSTANTINOPLE.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Queen of the Morn! Sultana of the East!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The splendour and extent of Constantinople are not within the
compass of one of our pages; but the annexed Engraving furnishes
some idea of a section of this queen of cities. It extends from
Seraglio Point to the Janissaries' Tower, and though commanding
only a portion of the city, includes the domes of the magnificent
mosques of Santa Sophia and the Sultan Achmet, which rise from a
vast assemblage of towers, palaces, minarets, &amp;c. in every
style of architecture.</p>
<p>We have so often and so recently touched upon the ancient and
modern state of Constantinople, that we fear a recapitulation of
its splendour would be uninviting to our readers.<a id=
"footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> Nevertheless, as its mention is so
frequently coupled with the seat of war, and the "expulsion of the
Turks from Europe," our illustration will at this period be
interesting, as well as in some measure, explanatory of the
position of the city, which is so advantageous as to make it appear
fit for the seat of dominion over the whole world. Can we then be
surprised at its forming so tempting a lure to surrounding
nations?</p>
<p>The city stands at the eastern extremity of Romania, on a neck
of land that advances towards Natolia; on the south it is washed by
the sea of Marmora, and on the north-east by the gulf of the Golden
Horn. It is built, like ancient Rome, on seven hills, rising one
above the other in beautiful succession, and sloping gently towards
the water; the whole forming an irregular triangle, about twelve
miles in circumference, the entire of which space is closely
covered with palaces, mosques, baths, fountains, and houses; at a
short distance the proudly swelling domes of 300 mosques, the tall
and elegant minarets, crowned by glittering crescents, the ancient
towers on the walls, and the gaudily coloured kiosks and houses
rising above the stupendous trees in the seraglio, situated on the
extreme point, form a rich, picturesque, and extraordinary scene.
The gulf of the Golden Horn, to the north-east of the city, forms a
noble and capacious harbour, four miles in length, by half a mile
in breadth, capable of securely containing 1,200 ships of the
largest size, and is generally filled with the curiously built
vessels and gaily decorated boats of the Turks; on the opposite
shore is the maritime town of Galata, containing the docks,
arsenals, cannon founderies, barracks, &amp;c.; above which stands
the populous suburb of Pera, the residence of the foreign ministers
of the Porte, and all foreigners of distinction, none whatever
being allowed to reside in the city. Beyond, as far as the eye can
reach, is an immense forest of cypress and mulberry trees, being
the extensive cemeteries of all persuasions. From Galata, the
European shore of the Bosphorus forms one continued line of towns;
palaces in every style of architecture, pleasure gardens, and
romantic villages. On the opposite, or Asiatic shore, stands the
extensive town of Scutari, also a suburb of Constantinople,
although in another quarter of the globe, and separated by a sea a
mile in breadth; and at a short distance is the ancient and ruinous
city of Calcedone. The group of the Prince's Islands, in the Sea of
Marmora, and the snow-clad summit of Mount Olympus, close the
prospect. Such is a mere outline of the natural and artificial
beauty of Constantinople.</p>
<p>The city itself is surrounded by walls, built of freestone, with
alternate layers of Roman brick, flanked by 478 towers; the walls,
however, are in several places so dilapidated as to be incapable of
any defence without great reparation. On the land side, the
fortifications consist of a triple wall, with towers at every 150
yards; the first wall being 30 feet in height; the second 20, and
about 30 feet from the first; the third is twelve feet in height;
beyond this is a fosse, thirty feet wide, now converted into
gardens, and filled with fine grown trees, and a low counterscarp.
There are five gates on this side, and several to the water. The
streets, of which there are 3,770, with the exception of two or
three, are narrow, irregular, badly paved, and exceedingly dirty,
the only scavengers being vultures and half-starved dogs. There are
fourteen imperial mosques, about 200 others, and above that number
of messjids or chapels. The number of houses is prodigious; in
1796, the register of Effendissy gave 88,185 within the walls; they
are mostly constructed of wood, and the dwellings of the lower
classes are mere wooden boxes, cool in summer, the windows being
unglazed, and in winter heated by pans of charcoal. Fires are
consequently very frequent. The khans, or warehouses of the
merchants are, however, fireproof; the bazaars <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span> are
also defended from fire, and are well built; and coffeehouses very
numerous. The city is amply supplied with water, there being 730
public baths, a superb fountain in the Chinese taste in every
street, and few houses without similar provision. The population of
the city and suburbs is estimated at upwards of 600,000; of these
above one half are Turks, the remainder Jews, Franks, Greeks,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>We have only space to particularize a few of the most prominent
buildings in our view. To the left is the Seraglio Point, or superb
palace of the Sultan, whose treasures almost realize the fables of
romance. Next is the superb dome of the Mosque of the Sultan
Achmet, without exception the finest building ever raised by the
Turks. It is surrounded by a lofty colonnade of marble, of various
colours, surmounted by 30 small domes: the large dome is supported
by four gigantic piers, covered as well as most of the interior,
with fresco paintings; it is rich in columns of verd antique,
Egyptian granite, and white marble; there are also four smaller
domes, similarly ornamented. Next, near the centre of the Engraving
is the Mosque of Santa Sophia, a truly superb and perfect monument
of antiquity, built at an expense of 320,000 pounds of silver,
(some authors say gold. <a id="footnotetag2" name=
"footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>) Next in
importance are the Mosques of the Sultans Osmyn, Bajazet, and
Selim; and the Gulf of the Golden Horn, or the Harbour.</p>
<p>Among the suburbs of Constantinople, Scutari is not the least
interesting, inasmuch as it leads us to notice the funereal customs
of the Turks, and their cemeteries, of which Scutari is the
principal site.</p>
<p>Interment almost immediately follows upon the decease of the
person; a practice common to all classes at Constantinople. The
corpse is carried to the grave on a bier by the friends of the
deceased: this is considered as a religious duty, it being declared
in the Koran, that he who carries a dead body the space of forty
paces, procures for himself the expiation of a great sin.<a id=
"footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a> <a href=
"#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> The graves are shallow, and thin
boards only, laid over the corpse, protect it from the immediate
pressure of the earth, which is set with flowers, according to the
custom of the Pythagoreans, and a cypress tree is planted near
every new grave. As a grave is never opened a second time, a vast
tract of country is occupied with these burial-fields, which add by
no means to the salubrity of the vicinity. Much is gained,
unquestionably, as regards the health of the inhabitants, by
burying without the cities; but the shallowness of the graves
contributes to render these vast accumulations of animal dust, at
certain seasons more especially, a source of pestilential miasmata.
The cemeteries near Scutari are immense, owing to the predilection
which the Turks of Europe preserve for being buried in
Asia&mdash;that quarter of the world in which are situated the holy
cities, Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, and Damascus. The author of
Anastasius gives the following vivid description of this
extraordinary spot:&mdash;</p>
<p>"A dense and motionless cloud of stagnant vapours ever shrouds
these dreary realms. From afar, a chilling sensation informs the
traveller that he approaches their dark and dismal precincts; and
as he enters them, an icy blast, rising from their inmost bosom,
rushes forth to meet his breath, suddenly strikes his chest, and
seems to oppose his progress. His very horse snuffs up the deadly
effluvia with signs of manifest terror, and, exhaling a cold and
clammy sweat, advances reluctantly over a hollow ground, which
shakes as he treads it, and loudly re-echoes his slow and fearful
step. So long and so busily has time been at work to fill this
chosen spot&mdash;so repeatedly has Constantinople poured into this
ultimate receptacle almost its whole contents&mdash;that the
capital of the living, spite of its immense population, scarcely
counts a single breathing inhabitant for every ten silent inmates
of this city of the dead. Already do its fields of blooming
sepulchres stretch far away on every side, across the brow of the
hills and the bend of the valleys; already are the avenues which
cross each other at every step in <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page132" name="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> this domain of death,
so lengthened, that the weary stranger, from whatever point he
comes, still finds before him many a dreary mile of road between
marshalled tombs and mournful cypresses, ere he reaches his
journey's seemingly receding end; and yet, every year does this
common patrimony of all the heirs to decay, still exhibit a rapidly
increasing size, a fresh and wider line of boundary, and a new belt
of young plantations, growing up between new flower beds of
graves.</p>
<p>"There, said I to myself, lie, scarcely one foot beneath the
surface of a swelling soil, ready to burst at every point with its
festering contents, more than half the generations whom death has
continued to mow down for nearly four centuries in the vast capital
of Islamism. There lie, side by side, on the same level, in cells
the size of their bodies, and only distinguished by a marble turban
somewhat longer or deeper&mdash;somewhat rounder or
squarer&mdash;personages, in life, far as heaven and earth asunder,
in birth, in station, in gifts of nature, and in long laboured
acquirements. There lie, sunk alike in their last sleep&mdash;alike
food for the worm that lives on death&mdash;the conqueror who
filled the universe with his name, and the peasant scarcely known
in his own hamlet; Sultan Mahmoud, and Sultan Mahmoud's perhaps
more deserving horse;<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a>
<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> elders bending under the
weight of years, and infants of a single hour; men with intellects
of angels, and men with understandings inferior to those of brutes;
the beauty of Georgia and the black of Sennaar; visiers, beggars,
heroes, and women.'"</p>
<p>The approach to Constantinople from the sea of Marmora is
likewise thus beautifully described by the same author, and will
form an appropriate conclusion:</p>
<p>"With eyes rivetted on the expanding splendour, I watched as
they came out of the bosom of the surrounding waters, the pointed
minarets, the swelling cupolas, and the innumerable habitations,
either stretching along the jagged shore, and reflecting their
shape in the mirror of the deep, or creeping up the crested
mountain, and tracing their outline on the expanse of the sky. At
first agglomerated in a single confused mass, the lesser part of
this immense whole seemed, as we advanced, by degrees to unfold, to
disengage themselves from each other, and to grow into various
groups, divided by wide chasms and deep indentures; until at last
the clusters, thus far still distantly connected, became
transformed, as if by magic, into three distinct cities, each
individually of prodigious extent, and each separated from the
other two by a wide arm of that sea whose silver tide encompassed
their base, and made its vast circuit rest half on Europe, and half
on Asia."</p>
<p>Since writing the above we have visited Mr. Burford's <i>New
Panorama of Constantinople</i>, which has lately been opened for
exhibition in the Strand; and although we cannot in this Number
enter into the detail of its merits, we recommend it to our
lionizing friends as one of Mr. Burford's most finished paintings,
and equal if not superior in effect to any exhibition in the
metropolis; but we reserve an account of its pictorial beauties for
our next publication.</p>

<h3>ILLUSTRATION OF SOME OLD PROVERBS, &amp;c.</h3>
<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>
<p><i>"Ax." To ask</i>. This word which now passes for a mere
vulgarism, is the original Saxon form, and used by Chaucer and
others. See "Tyrwhitt's Glossary." We find it also in Bishop Bale's
"God's Promises." "That their synne vengeaunce <i>axed</i>
continually." Old Plays. i. 18. Also in the "Four P.'s," by
Heywood, "And <i>axed</i> them thys question than." Old Pl. i. 84.
An <i>axing</i> is used by Chaucer for a request. Ben Jonson
introduces it jocularly:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A man out of wax,</p>
<p>As a lady would ax."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><span style="margin-left:3em"><i>Masques</i>, vol. 6, p.
85.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"<i>Between the Cup and the Lip</i>." The proverb that many
things fall out between the cup and the lip, is a literal version
of one in Latin. <i>Multo inter pocula ac libra cadunt</i>. The
origin of which was as follows:&mdash;A king of Thrace had planted
a vineyard, when one of his slaves, whom he had much oppressed in
that very work, prophesied that he should never taste of the wine
produced in it. The monarch disregarded the prediction, and when at
an entertainment he held a glassful of his own wine made from the
grape of that vineyard, he sent for the slave, and asked him what
he thought of his prophecy now; to which the other replied, "Many
things fall out between the cup and the lip," and he had scarcely
delivered this singular response, before news was brought that a
monstrous boar was laying waste the favourite vineyard. The king,
in a rage, put down the cup which he held in his hand, and hurried
out with his people to attack the boar; but being too eager, the
boar rushed upon him and killed him, without having tasted of the
wine. Such is the story related by some of the Greek writers, and
though evidently apocryphal, it certainly is productive of a good
practical moral.</p>
<p>"<i>In the merry pin</i>." This is said of those who have drunk
freely and are cheerful in their cups. Among the ancient northern
nations, it was customary to drink out of large horns, in which
were placed small pins, like a scale of distances, and he who
quaffed most was considered as a toper of the first magnitude, and
respected accordingly. The merry pin was that which stood pretty
far from the mouth of the horn, and he who, at a draught, reduced
the liquor to that point, was a man of no ordinary prowess in
bacchanalian contest.</p>
<p>"<i>Under the Rose be it spoken</i>." The rose being dedicated
by Cupid to Harpocrates, the god of Silence, to engage him to
conceal the amours of Venus, was an emblem of Silence; whence to
present it or hold it up to any person in discourse, served instead
of an admonition, that it was time for him to hold his peace; and
in entertaining rooms it was customary to place a rose above the
table, to signify that what was there spoken should be kept
private. This practice is described by the following
epigram:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Est rosa flos, Veneris cujus quo facta laterunt,</p>
<p>Harpocrati matri dona dicavit Amor,</p>
<p>Inde rosam mensis hospes suspendit amicis</p>
<p>Convivii et sub ea dicta tacenda sciat.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><span style="margin-left:3em"><i>Potter's Ant.
Greece</i>.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"<i>Cant</i>." This word, which is now generally applied to
fanatical preachers, and hypocritical apprentices in religion,
derives its name from two Scotch Presbyterian ministers, in the
reign of Charles II. They were father and son, both called Andrew
Cant; and Whitelocke in his "Memoirs," p. 511, after narrating the
defeat at Worcester, in 1651, says, "Divers Scotch ministers were
permitted to meet at Edinburgh, to keep a day of humiliation, as
they pretended, for their too much compliance with the King," and
in the same month when Lord Argyll had called a parliament, Mr.
Andrew Cant, a minister, said in his pulpit, that "God was bound to
hold this parliament, for that all other parliaments was called by
man, but this was brought about by his own hand."</p>
<p>"<i>An't please the Pigs</i>." In this phrase there is not only
a peculiarity of dialect, but the corruption of a word, and a
change of one thing for another. In the first place, <i>an</i>, in
the midland counties, is used for if; and pigs is evidently a
corruption of Pyx, the sacred vessel containing the host in Roman
Catholic countries. In the last place, the vessel is substituted
for the power itself, by an easy metonymy in the same manner as
when we talk of "the sense of the house," we do not mean to ascribe
intelligence to a material building; but to the persons in it
assembled for a deliberate purpose; the expression therefore
signifies no more than "<i>Deo volente</i>," or God willing.</p>
<p>"<i>Bumper</i>." In many parts of England any thing large is
called a bumper. Hence a bumping lass is a large girl of her age,
and a bumpkin is a large-limbed, uncivilized rustic; the idea of
grossness of size entering into the idea of a country bumpkin, as
well as that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name=
"page134"></a>[pg 134]</span>of unpolished rudeness. Dr. Johnson,
however, strangely enough deduces the word bumpkin from bump; but
what if it should prove to be a corruption of bumbard, or bombard:
in low Latin, bombardus, a great gun, and from thence applied to a
large flagon, or full glass. Thus the Lord Chamberlain says to the
porters who had been negligent in keeping out the mob.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i14">"You are lazy knaves:</p>
<p>And here ye lie, baiting of bombard, when</p>
<p>Ye should do service."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><span style="margin-left:3em"><i>Shaks. Hen</i>. VIII.
<i>Act</i> 5, <i>Scene</i> 3.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"Baiting of bombard" is a term for sitting and drinking, which
Nash in his "Supplycacyon to the Deuyll," calls by the like
metaphor, "bear baiting." So Shakspeare again in the "Tempest,"
says,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Yond same black cloud, yond huge one,</p>
<p>Seems like foul bombard, that would shed his liquor."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><span style="margin-left:3em"><i>Tempest, Act</i> 2,
<i>Scene</i> 2.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Which Theobald rightly explains thus: "A large vessel for
holding drink, as well as the piece of ordinance so called."</p>
<p>"<i>Latter Lammas</i>." Lammas day is the first day of August,
so called quasi, Lamb-mass, on which day the tenants that hold
lands of the Cathedral of York, which is dedicated to St. Peter, ad
Vincula, were bound by that tenure to bring a living lamb into the
church at high mass.&mdash;<i>Cornell's Interpreter</i>. Lammas day
was always a great day of account, for in the payment of rents our
ancestors distributed the year into four quarters, ending at
Candlemas, Whitsuntide, Lammas, and Martinmas, and this was as
common as the present divisions of Lady day, Midsummer, Michaelmas,
and Christmas. In regard to Lammas, in addition to its being one of
the days of reckoning, it appears from the Confessor's laws, that
it was the specific day whereon the Peter-pence, a tax very
rigorously executed, and the punctual payment of which was enforced
under a severe penalty, was paid. In this view then, Lammas stands
as a day of account, and Latter Lammas will consequently signify
the day of doom, which in effect, as to all payments of money, or
worldly transactions in money, is never. Latter here is used for
last, or the comparative for the superlative, just as it is in a
like case in our version of the book of Job, "I know that my
redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the
earth," meaning of course the last day, or the end of the world.
That the last day, or Latter Lammas, as to all temporal affairs is
never, may be illustrated by the following story:&mdash;A man at
confession owned his having stolen a sow and pigs; the father
confessor exhorted him to make restitution. The penitent said some
were sold, and some were killed, but the priest not satisfied with
this excuse, told him they would appear against him at the day of
judgment if he did not make restitution to the owner, upon which
the man replied, "Well, I'll return them to him then."</p>
<p>"<i>Lydford Law</i>." In Devonshire and Cornwall this saying is
common:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"First hang and draw,</p>
<p>Then hear the cause by Lydford Law."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sometimes it is expressed in this manner; "Lydford Law, by which
they hang men first, and try them afterwards." Lydford was formerly
a town of note, but now an inconsiderable village on the borders of
Dartmoor, not far from Tavistock. It is famous for a ruined castle,
under which is a dungeon that used to be a prison for the
confinement of persons who offended against the Stannary Courts of
Tavistock, Ashburton, Chapford, and Plimpton. These Stannary Courts
were erected by a charter of Edward III. for the purpose of
regulating the affairs of the tin mines in Devonshire, and of
determining causes among the tinners, whether criminal, or actions
for debt. The proceedings were very summary, and the prison
horribly offensive. Near Lydford is a famous waterfall, and a most
romantic view down the river Lyd; over which is a curious bridge
built with one arch. The parish is the largest in the kingdom,
including the whole Forest of Dartmoor. William Browne of
Tavistock, and the author of <i>Britannia's Pastorals</i>, gives a
humorous description of Lydford in the reign of James I.</p>

<h2>THE CONTEMPORARY TRAVELLER.</h2>

<h3>JOURNEY IN SEARCH OF THE RED INDIANS OF NEWFOUNDLAND.</h3>
<p>In the island of Newfoundland, an institution has been formed
for opening a communication with, and promoting the civilization
of, the Red Indians; and procuring, if possible, an authentic
history of that unhappy race of people, in order that their
language, customs, and pursuits, may be contrasted with those of
other tribes of Indians and nations. The interior of the island is
less known than any other British possessions abroad; but, from the
exertions of the above Society, more information has been collected
concerning the natives, than has been obtained during the two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>[pg
135]</span> centuries and a half in which Newfoundland has been in
possession of Europeans. The last journey was undertaken by W.E.
Cormack, Esq., president of the Society. His report has appeared in
a recent Number of the <i>Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal</i>,
and will, we are persuaded, be interesting to our readers:</p>
<p>"My party," says Mr. Cormack, "consisted of three Indians, whom
I procured from among the other different tribes, viz. an
intelligent and able man of the Abenakie tribe, from Canada; an
elderly Mountaineer from Labrador; and an adventurous young
Micmack, a native of this island, together with myself. It was my
intention to have commenced our search at White Bay, which is
nearer the northern extremity of the island than where we did, and
to have travelled southward. But the weather not permitting to
carry my party thither by water, after several days' delay, I
unwillingly changed my line of route.</p>
<p>"On the 31st of October, 1828, last, we entered the country at
the mouth of the River Exploits, on the north side, at what is
called the Northern Arm. We took a north-westerly direction, to
lead us to Hall's Bay, which place we reached through an almost
uninterrupted forest, over a hilly country, in eight days. This
tract comprehends the country interior from New Bay, Badger Bay,
Seal Bay, &amp;c.; these being minor bays, included in Green or
Notre Dame Bay, at the north-east part of the island, and well
known to have been always heretofore the summer residence of the
Red Indians.</p>
<p>"On the fourth day after our departure, at the east end of
Badger Bay-Great Lake, at a <i>portage</i> known by the name of the
Indian Path, we found traces made by the Red Indians, evidently in
the spring or summer of the preceding year. Their party had had two
canoes; and here was a <i>canoe-rest</i>, on which the daubs of red
ochre, and the roots of trees used to fasten or tie it together
appeared fresh. A canoe-rest, is simply a few beams supported
horizontally about five feet from the ground, by perpendicular
posts. A party with two canoes, when descending from the interior
to the sea-coast, through such a part of the country as this, where
there are troublesome portages, leave one canoe resting, bottom up,
on this kind of frame, to protect it from injury by the weather,
until their return. Among other things which lay strewed about
here, were a spearshaft, eight feet in length, recently made and
ochred; parts of old canoes, fragments of their skin-dresses,
&amp;c. For some distance around, the trunks of many of the birch,
and of that species of spruce pine called here the Var (<i>Pinus
balsamifera</i>) had been rinded; these people using the inner part
of the bark of that kind of tree for food. Some of the cuts in the
trees with the axe, were evidently made the preceding year. Besides
these, we were elated by other encouraging signs. The traces left
by the Red Indians are so peculiar, that we were confident those we
saw here were made by them.</p>
<p>"This spot has been a favourite place of settlement with these
people. It is situated at the commencement of a <i>portage</i>,
which forms a communication by a path between the sea-coast at
Badger Bay, about eight miles to the north-east, and a chain of
lakes extending westerly and southerly from hence, and discharging
themselves by a rivulet into the River Exploits, about thirty miles
from its mouth. A path also leads from this place to the lakes,
near New Bay, to the eastward. Here are the remains of one of their
villages, where the vestiges of eight or ten winter
<i>mamatecks</i>, or wigwams, each intended to contain from six to
eighteen or twenty people, are distinctly seen close together.
Besides these, there are the remains of a number of summer wigwams.
Every winter wigwam has close by it a small square-mouthed or
oblong pit, dug into the earth, about four feet deep, to preserve
their stores, &amp;c. in. Some of these pits were lined with birch
rind. We discovered also in this village the remains of a
vapour-bath. The method used by the Boeothicks to raise the steam,
was by pouring water on large stones made very hot for the purpose,
in the open air, by burning a quantity of wood around them; after
this process, the ashes were removed, and a hemispherical framework
closely covered with skins, to exclude the external air, was fixed
over the stones. The patient then crept in under the skins, taking
with him a birch-rind bucket of water, and a small bark-dish to dip
it out, which, by pouring on the stones, enabled him to raise the
steam at pleasure.<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a>
<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>"At Hall's Bay we got no useful <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page136" name="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span> information, from the
three (and the only) English families settled there. Indeed we
could hardly have expected any; for these, and such people, have
been the unchecked and ruthless destroyers of the tribe, the
remnant of which we were in search of. After sleeping one night in
a <i>house</i>, we again struck into the country to the
westward.</p>
<p>"In five days we were on the high lands south of White Bay, and
in sight of the high lands east of the Bay of Islands, on the west
coast of Newfoundland. The country south and west of us was low and
flat, consisting of marshes, extending in a southerly direction
more than thirty miles. In this direction lies the famous Red
Indians' Lake. It was now near the middle of November, and the
winter had commenced pretty severely in the interior. The country
was every where covered with snow, and, for some days past, we had
walked over the small ponds on the ice. The summits of the hills on
which we stood had snow on them, in some places, many feet deep.
The deer were migrating from the rugged and dreary mountains in the
north, to the low mossy barren, and more woody parts in the south;
and we inferred, that if any of the Red Indians had been at White
Bay during the past summer, they might be at that time stationed
about the borders of the low tract of country before us, at the
<i>deer-passes</i>, or were employed somewhere else in the
interior, killing deer for winter provision. At these passes, which
are particular places in the migration lines of path, such as the
extreme ends of, and straights in, many of the large
lakes&mdash;the foot of valleys between high and rugged
mountains&mdash;fords in the large rivers, and the like&mdash;-the
Indians kill great numbers of deer with very little trouble, during
their migrations. We looked out for two days from the summits of
the hills adjacent, trying to discover the smoke from the camps of
the Red Indians; but in vain. These hills command a very extensive
view of the country in every direction.</p>
<p>"We now determined to proceed towards the Red Indians' Lake,
sanguine that, at that known rendezvous, we could find the objects
of our search.</p>
<p>"In about ten days we got a glimpse of this beautifully majestic
and splendid sheet of water. The ravages of fire, which we saw in
the woods for the last two days, indicated that man had been near.
We looked down on the lake, from the hills at the northern
extremity, with feelings of anxiety and admiration:&mdash;No canoe
could be discovered moving on its placid surface, in the distance.
We were the first Europeans who had seen it in an unfrozen state,
for the three former parties who had visited it before, were here
in the winter, when its waters were frozen and covered over with
snow. They had reached it from below, by way of the River Exploits,
on the ice. We approached the lake with hope and caution; but found
to our mortification that the Red Indians had deserted it for some
years past. My party had been so excited, so sanguine, and so
determined to obtain an interview of some kind with these people,
that, on discovering from appearances every where around us, that
the Red Indians&mdash;the terror of the Europeans as well as the
other Indian inhabitants of Newfoundland&mdash;no longer existed,
the spirits of one and all of us were very deeply affected. The old
mountaineer was particularly overcome. There were every where
indications, that this had long been the central and undisturbed
rendezvous of the tribe, when they had enjoyed peace and security.
But these primitive people had abandoned it, after having been
tormented by parties of Europeans during the last eighteen years.
Fatal rencounters had on these occasions unfortunately taken
place."</p>

<h2>THE SELECTOR, AND LITERARY NOTICES OF <i>NEW WORKS</i>.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>AN HONOURABLE "INDEPENDENT" FAMILY.</h3>
<p>The Honourable Mister Augustus Headerton, who lived once in
yonder villa, was the youngest of eleven children, and consequently
the junior brother of the noble Lord of Headerton, nephew of the
Honourable Justice Cleaveland, nephew of Admiral Barrymore, K.C.B.,
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.; and cousin first, second, third, fourth,
fifth, sixth, or seventh remove&mdash;to all the honourables and
dishonourables in the country.</p>
<p>When the old earl died, he left four Chancery suits, and a
nominal estate to the heir apparent, to whom he also bequeathed his
three younger brothers and sisters, who had only small annuities
from their mother's fortune, being assured that (to use his own
words), "he might <i>depend</i> on him for the honour of the
family, to provide for them handsomely." And so he did (in
his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>[pg
137]</span> own estimation); his lady sisters had "the run of the
house," and Mr. Augustus Headerton had the run of the stables, the
use of hunters and dogs, and was universally acknowledged to
possess "a proper spirit," because he spent three times more than
his income. "He bates the world and all, for beauty, in a hunting
jacket," exclaimed the groom. "He flies a gate beyant any living
sowl I iver seed, and his tallyho, my jewel&mdash;'twould do y'er
heart good to hear his tallyho!" said my lord's huntsman. "He's a
generous jontleman as any in the kingdom&mdash;I'll say that for
him, any day in the year," echoed the coachman. "He's admired more
nor any jintleman as walks Steven's Green in a month o' Sundays,
I'll go bail," continued Miss Jenny Roe, the ladies' maid.</p>
<p>"Choose a profession!" Oh! no; impossible. An Irish gentleman
choose a profession! But the Honourable Mr. Augustus Headerton
chose a wife, and threw all his relations, including Lord
Headerton, the Honourable Justice Cleaveland, Admiral Barrymore,
K.C.B., and his cousins to the fiftieth remove, into strong
convulsions, or little fits. She, the lady, had sixty thousand
pounds; that, of course, they could not object to. She had eloped
with the Honourable Mr. Augustus Headerton;&mdash;mere youthful
indiscretion. She was little and ugly;&mdash;that only concerned
her husband. She was proud and extravagant;&mdash;those (they said)
were lady-like failings. She was ignorant and stupid;&mdash;her
sisters-in-law would have pardoned that. She was vulgar;&mdash;that
was awkward. Her father was a carcass butcher in Cole's Lane
market&mdash;death and destruction!</p>
<p>It could never be forgiven! the cut direct was unanimously
agreed on, and the little lady turned up her little nose in
disdain, as her handsome barouche rolled past the lumbering
carriage of the Right Honourable Lord Headerton. She persuaded her
husband to purchase that beautiful villa, in view of the family
domain, that she might have more frequent opportunities of
bringing, as she elegantly expressed it, "the proud beggars to
their trumps;&mdash;and why not?&mdash;money's money, all the world
over." The Honourable Mister Augustus <i>depended</i> on his agent
for the purchase, and some two thousand and odd pounds were
consequently paid, or said to have been paid, for it, more than its
value. And then commenced the general warfare; full purse and empty
head&mdash;<i>versus</i> no purse, and old nobility. They had the
satisfaction of ruining each other&mdash;the full purse was emptied
by devouring duns, and the old nobility suffered by its connexion
with vulgarity.</p>
<p>"I want to know, Honourable Mister Augustus
Headerton"&mdash;(the lady always gave the full name when
addressing her husband; she used to say it was all she got for her
money),&mdash;"I want to know, Honourable Mister Augustus
Headerton, the reason why the music master's lessons, given to the
Misses Headerton (they were blessed with seven sweet pledges of
affection), have not been paid for? I desired the steward to see to
it, and you know I <i>depend</i> on him to settle these
matters."</p>
<p>The Honourable Mrs. Augustus Headerton rang the bell&mdash;"Send
Martin up."</p>
<p>"Mister Martin," the lady began, "what is the reason that Mr.
Langi's account has not been paid?"</p>
<p>"My master, ma'am knows that I have been anxious for him to look
over the accounts; the goings-out are so very great, and the
comings-in, as far as I know"&mdash;The Honourable Mister Augustus
Headerton spilt some of the whiskey-punch he was drinking, over a
splendid hearth-rug, which drew the lady's attention from what
would have been an unpleasant <i>eclaircissement</i>.</p>
<p>"I cannot understand why difficulties should arise. I am certain
I brought a fortune large enough for all extravagance," was the
lady's constant remark when expenditure was mentioned. Years pass
over the heads of the young&mdash;and they grow old; and over the
heads of fools&mdash;but they never grow wise.</p>
<p>The Honourable Mister and Mistress Augustus Headerton were
examples of this truth;&mdash;their children grew up around
them&mdash;but could derive no support from their parent root. The
mother had <i>depended</i> on governesses and masters for the
education of her girls&mdash;and on their beauty, connexions, or
accomplishments, to procure them husbands. The father did not deem
the labours of study fit occupation for the sons of an ancient
house:&mdash;"<i>Depend</i> upon it," he would say, "they'll all do
well with my connexions&mdash;they will be able to command what
they please." The Honourable Mistress Augustus could not now boast
of a full purse, for they had long been living on the memory of
their once ample fortune.</p>
<p>The Honourable Mister Augustus Headerton died, in the
forty-fifth year of his age, of inflammation, caught in an old
limekiln, where he was concealed <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page138" name="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span> to avoid an arrest for
the sum of 180 guineas, for black Nell, the famous filly, who won
the cup on the Curragh of Kildare&mdash;purchased in his name, but
without his knowledge, by his second son, the pride of the
family&mdash;commonly called dashing Dick.</p>
<p>All I know further of the Honourable Mistress Augustus Headerton
is, that</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"She played at cards, and died."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Miss Georgiana&mdash;the beauty, and greatest fool of the
family, who <i>depended</i> on her face as a fortune, did get a
husband&mdash;an old, rich West India planter, and eloped, six
months after marriage, with an officer of dragoons.</p>
<p>Miss Celestina was really clever and accomplished. "Use her
abilities for her own support!" Oh, no! not for worlds&mdash;Too
proud to work, but not too proud to beg, she <i>depended</i> on her
relations, and played toady to all who would.</p>
<p>Miss Louisa&mdash;not clever; but in all other respects,
ditto&mdash;ditto.</p>
<p>Miss Charlotte was always very romantic; refused a respectable
banker with indignation, and married her uncle's footman&mdash;for
love.</p>
<p>Having sketched the female part of the family first (a
compliment by the way they do not always receive from their own
sex)&mdash;I will tell you what I remember of the gentlemen.</p>
<p>"The Emperor," as Mr. Augustus was called, from his stately
manner and dignified deportment, aided by as much self-esteem as
could well be contained in a human body, <i>depended</i>, without
any "compunctuous visitings of conscience," on the venison, claret,
and champagne of his friends, and thought all the time he did them
honour:&mdash;and thus he passed his life.</p>
<p>"Dashing Dick" was the opposite of the Emperor; sung a good
song&mdash;told a good story&mdash;and gloried in making ladies
blush. He <i>depended</i> on his cousin, Colonel Bloomfield,
procuring him a commission in his regiment, and cheated tailors,
hosiers, glovers, coach-makers, and even lawyers, with impunity.
Happily for the world at large, Dashing Dick broke his neck in a
steeple chase, on a stolen horse, which he would have been hanged
for purloining, had he lived a day longer.</p>
<p>Ferdinand was the bonne-bouche of the family: they used to call
him "the Parson!" Excellent Ferdinand!&mdash;he <i>depended</i> on
his exertions; and, if ever the name of Headerton rises in the
scale of moral or intellectual superiority, it will be owing to the
steady and virtuous efforts of Mister Ferdinand Headerton,
merchant, in the good city of B&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<h3>PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</h3>
<p>We quote the following from the portion of the <i>Library of
Entertaining Knowledge</i>, with the above title&mdash;to show the
mode in which the heads of the respective chapters are
illustrated:</p>
<p><i>Obscure Origin</i>.</p>
<p>"The parents of SEBASTIAN CASTALIO, the elegant Latin translator
of the Bible, were poor peasants, who lived among the mountains in
Dauphiny.</p>
<p>"The Abb&eacute; HAUTEFEUILLE, who distinguished himself in the
seventeenth century, by his inventions in clock and watch making,
was the son of a baker.</p>
<p>"PARINI, the modern satiric poet of Italy, was the son of a
peasant, who died when he was in his boyhood, and left him to be
the only support of his widowed mother; while, to add to his
difficulties, he was attacked in his nineteenth year by a
paralysis, which rendered him a cripple for life.</p>
<p>"The parents of Dr. JOHN PRIDEAUX, who afterwards rose to be
Bishop of Worcester, were in such poor circumstances, that they
were with difficulty able to keep him at school till he had learned
to read and write; and he obtained the rest of his education by
walking on foot to Oxford, and getting employed in the first
instance as assistant in the kitchen of Exeter College, in which
society he remained till he gradually made his way to a
fellowship.</p>
<p>"The father of INIGO JONES, the great architect, who built the
Banqueting-house at Whitehall, and many other well known edifices,
was a cloth-worker; and he himself was also destined originally for
a mechanical employment.</p>
<p>"Sir EDMUND SAUNDERS, Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench
in the reign of Charles II., was originally an errand boy at the
Inns of Court, and gradually acquired the elements of his knowledge
of the law by being employed to copy precedents.</p>
<p>"LINNAEUS, the founder of the science of Botany, although the
son of the clergyman of a small village in Sweden, was for some
time apprenticed to a shoemaker; and was only rescued from his
humble employment by accidentally meeting one day a physician named
Rothman, who, having entered into conversation with him, was so
much struck with his intelligence, that he sent him to the
university.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>[pg
139]</span>
<p>"The father of MICHAEL LOMONOSOFF, one of the most celebrated
Russian poets of the last century, and who eventually attained the
highest literary dignities in his own country, was only a simple
fisherman. Young Lomonosoff had great difficulty in acquiring as
much education as enabled him to read and write; and it was only by
running away from his father's house, and taking refuge in a
monastery at Moscow, that he found means to obtain an acquaintance
with the higher branches of literature.</p>
<p>"The famous BEN JONSON worked for some time as a bricklayer or
mason; 'and let not them blush,' says Fuller, speaking of this
circumstance in his "English Worthies," with his usual amusing, but
often expressive quaintness, 'let not them blush that have, but
those that have not, a lawful calling. He helped in the building of
the new structure of Lincoln's Inn, when, having a trowel in his
hand, he had a book in his pocket.'</p>
<p>"PETER RAMUS, one of the most celebrated writers and intrepid
thinkers of the sixteenth century, was employed in his childhood as
a shepherd, and obtained his education by serving as a lacquey in
the College of Navarre.</p>
<p>"The Danish astronomer, LONGOMONTANUS, was the son of a
labourer, and, while attending the academical lectures at Wyburg
through the day, was obliged to work for his support during a part
of the night.</p>
<p>"The elder DAVID PAREUS, the eminent German Protestant divine,
who was afterwards Professor of Theology at Heidelberg, was placed
in his youth as an apprentice, first with an apothecary, and then
with a shoemaker.</p>
<p>"HANS SACHS, one of the most famous of the early German poets,
and a scholar of considerable learning, was the son of a tailor,
and served an apprenticeship himself, first to a shoemaker, and
afterwards to a weaver, at which last trade, indeed, he continued
to work during the rest of his life.</p>
<p>"JOHN FOLCZ, another old German poet, was a barber.</p>
<p>"LUCAS CORNELISZ, a Dutch painter of the sixteenth century, who
visited England during the reign of Henry VIII., and was patronized
by that monarch, was obliged, while in his own country, in order to
support his large family, to betake himself to the profession of a
cook.</p>
<p>"Dr. ISAAC MADDOX, who, in the reign of George II., became
bishop, first of St. Asaph, and then of Worcester, and who is well
known by his work in defence of the Doctrine and Discipline of the
Church of England, lost both his parents, who belonged to a very
humble rank of life, at an early age, and was, in the first
instance, placed by his friends with a pastrycook.</p>
<p>"The late Dr. ISAAC MILNER, Dean of Carlisle, and Lucasian
Professor of the Mathematics at Cambridge, who had the reputation
of one of the first mathematicians of that University, and who
published some ingenious papers on Chemistry and Natural
Philosophy, in the 'Philosophical Transactions,' was originally a
weaver&mdash;as was also his brother JOSEPH, the well known, author
of a 'History of the Church.' Of the same profession was also, in
his younger days, the late Dr. JOSEPH WHITE, Professor of Arabic at
Oxford.</p>
<p>"CASSERIO, a well known Italian anatomist, was initiated in the
elements of Medical Science by a surgeon of Padua, with whom he had
lived originally as a domestic servant.</p>
<p>"JOHN CHRISTIAN THEDEN, who rose to be chief surgeon to the
Prussian army under Frederick II. had in his youth been apprenticed
to a tailor."</p>
<p><i>Influence of Accident in directing Pursuits</i>.</p>
<p>"The celebrated Bernard Palissy, to whom France was indebted, in
the sixteenth century, for the introduction of the manufacture of
enamelled pottery, had his attention first attracted to the art,
his improvements in which, form to this time the glory of his name
among his countrymen, by having one day seen by chance a beautiful
enamelled cup, which had been brought from Italy. He was then
struggling to support his family by his attempts in the art of
painting, in which he was self-taught; and it immediately occurred
to him that, if he could discover the secret of making these cups,
his toils and difficulties would be at an end. From that moment his
whole thoughts were directed to this object; and in one of his
works he has himself given us such an account of the unconquerable
zeal with which he prosecuted his experiments, as it is impossible
to read without the deepest interest. For some time he had little
or nothing to expend upon the pursuit which he had so much at
heart; but at last he happened to receive a considerable sum of
money for a work which he had finished, and this enabled him to
commence his researches. He spent the whole of his money, however,
without meeting with any success, and he was now poorer than ever.
Yet it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>[pg
140]</span> was in vain that his wife and friends besought him to
relinquish what they deemed his chimerical and ruinous project. He
borrowed more money, with which he repeated his experiments; and,
when he had no more fuel wherewith to feed his furnaces, he cut
down his chairs and tables for that purpose. Still his success was
inconsiderable. He was now actually obliged to give a person, who
had assisted him, part of his clothes by way of remuneration,
having nothing else left; and, with his wife and children starving
before his eyes, and by their appearance silently reproaching him
as the cause of their sufferings, he was at heart miserable enough.
But he neither despaired, nor suffered his friends to know what he
felt; persevering, in the midst of all his misery, a gay demeanour,
and losing no opportunity of renewing his pursuit of the object
which he all the while felt confident he should one day accomplish.
And at last, after sixteen years of persevering exertion, his
efforts were crowned with complete success, and his fortune was
made. Palissy was, in all respects, one of the most extraordinary
men of his time; in his moral character displaying a
high-mindedness and commanding energy altogether in harmony with
the reach and originality of conception by which his understanding
was distinguished. Although a Protestant, he had escaped, through
the royal favour, from the massacre of St. Bartholomew; but, having
been soon after shut up in the Bastille, he was visited in his
prison by the king, who told him, that if he did not comply with
the established religion, he should be forced, however unwillingly,
to leave him in the hands of his enemies. 'Forced!' replied
Palissy, 'This is not to speak like a king; but they who force you
cannot force me; I can die!' He never regained his liberty, but
ended his life in the Bastille, in the ninetieth year of his
age."</p>

<h2>SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>ARRIVAL AT MARGATE.</h3>
<h4><i>From "The Monthly Club" of Sharpe's London
Magazine</i>.</h4>
<p>The buildings of Margate now became evident, and every minute
developed some new feature in the landscape; all the party
abandoned their sitting to enjoy the view. The curved pier painted
pea green and covered with Cockneys, now was disclosed to our eyes,
and my old friend from Leicester was again staggered into a
profound silence, by being told that a row of houses with a
windmill at the end of it, was <i>Buenos Ayres</i>. I saw his
amazement, but he did not betray his ignorance in speech as the
French actress did, who was in London some years since, and when
dining on the Adelphi Terrace was shown Waterloo Bridge. After
gazing at it, with a degree of pathos, partly national and partly
theatrical, she heaved a sigh for the brave fellows who had
perished in the neighbourhood, and feelingly inquired whereabouts
the farm of <i>Haye Saint</i> was&mdash;this is literally a fact
and is vouched for&mdash;nor is the absence of geographical
knowledge in the natives of France, confined to the lady&mdash;she
is by no means a solitary instance of the most glorious ignorance
of localities.&mdash;The Turks too, talk of Ireland as a disorderly
part of London; and an American, during the last winter, lecturing
in Germany, referring to the great improvements which have recently
taken place in England, enumerated, amongst other stupendous works
of art, the Menai Bridge, which he informed his hearers united
IRELAND with WALES.</p>
<p>As we approached the harbour we seemed to fly&mdash;the jetty
and pier became more and more crowded&mdash;it was evident we had
created "an interest;" the hurry and bustle on board appeared to
increase as we neared the shore, and the sudden tranquillization of
the hubbub by the magical words, "stop her," of the master
evidently excited a mingled feeling of wonder and satisfaction in
the breast of our Leicestershire companion, whose countenance had
previously indicated a strong suspicion that it was the captain's
intention to try the relative strength of our vessel's bow and the
nob end of Mr. Jarvis's jetty.</p>
<p>I never shall forget his delight as we tranquilly glided to the
side of the landing-place, nor his violent indignation when
stepping out of the boat in a pair <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page142" name="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span> of jockey boots, and
selecting, what appeared to his ruralized vision, a <i>verdant</i>
spot; his feet slid from under him, and he got a fall unmodified in
its disagreeable results by the excitement of the sport so
prevalent in his native country.</p>
<p>"Who built this fine stone affair?" said R&mdash;&mdash;,
pointing to the pea-green promenade on our right.</p>
<p>"The people of Margate," said some one.</p>
<p>"I thought nobody in England but the king could make a
<i>pier</i>," said R&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p>"Come, come," cried B&mdash;&mdash;, "let us be grave for a
minute or two; we look more like a parcel of boys landing than a
grave and learned body."</p>
<p>"Youth is the time for punning," said R&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p>"It is no great crime when one is older," said
B&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p>"That I deny," answered our wag; "it may be good in
<i>youth</i>, but it is <i>bad in age.</i>"</p>
<p>The groan which followed this last pun of the voyage reechoed
along the shore, and it was not until we reached Howe's hotel, a
sort of Bath York House stuck in the middle of Golden Square,
London, that the tumult died away.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE UNICORN.</h3>
<p>In the physical world, some of our secrets are disappearing; and
though Captain Parry failed to find out the pole, and we believe,
with that worthy navigator, that the world have been dreaming from
the beginning, and that there is no pole; and though Captain Ross
will go further and fare worse, yet things are turning up now and
then that our most benevolent scepticism cannot resist. But among
other plunders of the imagination, they are going to rob us of the
unicorn. For two thousand years and upwards, a short date in the
history of human quarrel about nothings, the sages of this world
have been doubting and deciding on the existence of this showy
creature. Pliny would have sworn to his having all but seen it, and
he would have sworn that too, if any one had taken the trouble to
ask him. Kircher, and a few of the German naturalists, and
black-letter fools&mdash;every naturalist and black-letter man
being more or less a fool&mdash;dug up the question out of the pit
of Teutonic dulness, and ever since, every traveller beyond the
Needles, has had his theory, which was quite as good as his fact,
and his fact, which was quite as good as his theory.</p>
<p>The topic perished in Germany, being stifled under professor
Bopp and Sanscrit, Professor Semler and Scepticism, Professor Jahn
and Jacobinism, and the whole vast feather-bed suffocation of
Professor Kotzebue and Comedy. But in England it was endeared to us
by associations "deep in every truly British heart," as the
chairmen of our tavern parties say over their third bottle. We had
seen it for ages gallantly climbing the slippery heights of the
kingly crown on show boards, carriages, transparencies, theatres,
and the new, matchless, hydropyric, or fiery and watery fairy
palace of Vauxhall. It met us in every material, from the gilt
<i>confitures</i> of Bartholomew fair, to the gold plateau of the
"table laid for sixty," at St. James's. All the dilettanti were
immersed in the great national question of its shape and features.
Mr. Barrow, in a journey of exploration, which extended to three
miles beyond the Cape, believed that he saw it, but strongly
doubted its existence. M. Vaillant never saw it, nor believed that
any one ever did, but was as sure of its existence as if it had
slept in his bosom, and been unto him as a daughter. Mr. Russel had
one, which he milked twice a day, and drove in a curricle to visit
the Queen of Madagascar. Doctor Lyall is writing a quarto from
Madagascar, to deny the statement in toto; admitting, however, that
there is a rumour of the being of some nondescript of the kind in
the mountains, somewhat between the size of the elephant and the
Shetland pony; but that he and we think the subject-matter will
turn out asinine. But now a Mr. Ruppell, after a long sojourn in
the north-east of Africa, comes at once to cheer and dishearten us
by the discovery, that in Kordofan, if any one knows where that is,
the unicorn exists; stated to be of the size of a small horse, of
the slender make of the gazelle, and furnished with a long,
straight, slender horn in the male, which was wanting in the
female. According to the statements made by various persons, it
inhabits the deserts to the south of Kordofan, is uncommonly fleet,
and comes only occasionally to the Koldagi Heive mountains on the
borders of Kordofan. This, it must be acknowledged, is a sad
falling off from the rival of the lion, that we have honoured so
long in the arms of England. But we sincerely hope, that by the
next arrival, it will not degenerate into a cow, or worse, a goat.
But he tells us, that to our knowledge of the giraffe he has added
considerably. He obtained in Nubia and Kordofan five specimens, two
of which were males <span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name=
"page143"></a>[pg 143]</span> and three females. He regards the
horns as constituting the principal generic character, they being
formed by distinct bones, united to the frontal and parietal bones
by a very obvious suture, and having throughout the same structure
with the other bones. In both sexes one of these abnormal bones is
situated on each branch of the coronal suture, and the male
possesses an additional one placed more anteriorly, and occupying
the middle of the frontal suture. The anomalous position of this
appendage furnishes a complete refutation of the theory of Camper
with regard to the unicorn, that such an occurrence was contrary to
nature, and proves at least the possibility of the existence of
such an animal. Professor Camper is an ass, of course; but when are
we to expect any thing better from the illustrissimi of the land of
sour-krout? Give a Doctor Magnificus his due allowance of the worst
tobacco, and the worst beer in the world, with a ream of half-brown
paper, and a Leipsic catalogue to plunder, and he will in three
months write any subject dead&mdash;smother the plainest truth with
an accumulation of absurdity, astonishing, as the work of a
creature with but two hands&mdash;and prove that the earth is but a
huge oyster, in which Germany is the pearl; or that man is only a
reclaimed baboon, of which all the wit is centered in Weimar.</p>

<h3>A PUNSTER.</h3>
<p>Dr. Barton was a punster. He said, "the fellows of my college
wished to have an organ in the chapel, but I put a stop to it;"
whether for the sake of the pun, or because he disliked music, is
uncertain. He invited, for the love of punning, Mr. Crowe and Mr.
Rooke to dine with him; and having given Mr. Birdmore, another
guest, a hint to be rather after the time, on his appearing, said,
"Mr. Rook! Mr. Crowe! I beg leave to introduce one <i>Bird
more</i>." He married his niece to a gentleman of the hopeful name
of <i>Buckle</i>. The enterprise succeeded beyond his expectation.
Mrs. Buckle was delivered of twins. "A pair of Buckles!" "Boys or
girls?" said a congratulating friend; the answer may be supposed.
To him, though it has been attributed to others, belongs the glory
or the shame of having said to one, who having re-established his
health by a diet of milk and eggs, took a wife:&mdash;"So, you have
been <i>egged</i> on to matrimony: I hope the <i>yoke</i> will sit

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
